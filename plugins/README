Place here the Plugins you want to add to RosarioSIS.

Activate them via:
School > School Configuration > Plugins

Every plugin must have a functions.php file containing the functions to be automatically loaded by RosarioSIS.
The config.inc.php file is optional. It is included by the modules/School_Setup/includes/Plugins.inc.php file when the Configuration link in the plugin listing is clicked.
