# INSTALLATION DIRECTIONS

## RosarioSIS Student Information System

Version 4.1
-----------

NOTE: Before Installing RosarioSIS, you must read and agree to the included [license](LICENSE).

RosarioSIS is a web based application which relies on other facilities such as a web server, PHP server-side scripting, and PostgreSQL database server.

For RosarioSIS to work you must first have your web server working, PostgreSQL working, PHP working (including the `pgsql`, `gettext`, `mbstring`, `gd`, `curl`, `xmlrpc` & `xml` extensions). Setting these up varies a lot with platform, operating system, and distribution so it is well beyond to scope of this brief install document.

RosarioSIS was tested on:

- Windows 7 x64 with Apache 2.2.21, Postgres 9.1, and PHP 5.3.9
- Windows 10 x86 with Apache 2.4.16, Postgres 9.3.6, and PHP 5.4.45
- Ubuntu 12.04 with Apache 2.2.22, Postgres 9.1, and PHP 5.3.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 with Apache 2.4.18, Postgres 9.3.10, and PHP 5.5.9
- Debian Jessie with Apache 2.4.16, Postgres 9.4, and PHP 5.6.13
- Debian Stretch with Apache 2.4.25, Postgres 9.6, and PHP 7.0.14
- Shared hosting with cPanel, nginx, Postgres 8.4, and PHP 5.6.27
- through Mozilla Firefox
- through BrowserStack for cross-browser compatibility (not compatible with Internet Explorer 8 or lower)

Minimum requirements: **PHP 5.3.2** & **PostgreSQL 8**

Installing the package
----------------------

Unzip the RosarioSIS distribution to a directory that is accessible to your web browser. Edit the `config.inc.sample.php` file to set the configuration variables as appropriate for your installation. Rename the file to `config.inc.php`.

- `$DatabaseServer` is the host name or IP for the database server
- `$DatabaseUsername` is the username used for authenticating the database
- `$DatabasePassword` is the password used for authenticating the database
- `$DatabaseName` is the database name
- `$DatabasePort` is the port number for accessing the database server

- `$pg_dumpPath` is full path to the postgres database dump utility, pg_dump
- `$wkhtmltopdfPath` is full path to wkhtmltopdf for PDF generation

- `$DefaultSyear` is default school year, should match the database to be able to login
- `$RosarioNotifyAddress` is the email address to send notifications to (new administrator)
- `$RosarioLocales` is a comma separated list of locale names (language packs, check the `locale/` folder for available locales)

#### Optional variables

- `$RosarioPath` is full path to RosarioSIS installation, you can define it statically or the runtime value derived from the `__FILE__` magic constant should work
- `$wkhtmltopdfAssetsPath` is path where wkhtmltopdf will access the `assets/` directory, possibly different than how the user's web browser finds it, empty string means no translation
- `$StudentPicturesPath` path to student pictures
- `$UserPicturesPath` path to user pictures
- `$PortalNotesFilesPath` path to portal notes attached files
- `$AssignmentsFilesPath` path to student assignments files
- `$FS_IconsPath` path to food service icons
- `$FileUploadsPath` path to file uploads
- `$LocalePath` path were the language packs are stored. You need to restart Apache at each change in this directory.
- `$PNGQuantPath` path to [PNGQuant](https://pngquant.org/) for PNG compression.
- `$RosarioErrorsAddress` is the email address to send errors to (PHP fatal, database, hacking)
- `$Timezone` sets the default time zone used by date/time functions. See [List of Supported Timezones](http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php).
- `$ETagCache` set to `false` to deactivate the [ETag cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag) and disable "private" session cache. See [Sessions and security](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/session.security.php).

  [Debug mode: add the following line to activate]
- `define( 'ROSARIO_DEBUG', true );`


Database setup
--------------

Now, you're ready to setup the RosarioSIS database. If you have access to the command prompt for your server, follow these instructions. If you're using phpPGAdmin or a similar tool, import the `rosariosis.sql` file included in this package.

1. Open a command prompt window.

2. Login as the postgres user:
	`server$ sudo -i -u postgres`

3. Get a PostgreSQL prompt:
	`server$ psql`

4. Create the rosariosis user:
	`postgres=# CREATE USER rosariosis_user WITH PASSWORD 'rosariosis_user_password';`

5. Create the rosariosis database:
	`postgres=# CREATE DATABASE rosariosis_db WITH ENCODING 'UTF8' OWNER rosariosis_user;`

6. Logout of PostgreSQL:
	`postgres=# \q` &
	`server$ exit`

7. Run the RosarioSIS SQL file:
	`server$ psql -f INSTALL_DIRECTORY/rosariosis.sql rosariosis_db rosariosis_user`

Also, the [`pg_hba.conf`](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html) file may have to be altered to enable password (`md5`) peer authentication:
```
# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     md5
```

That's it!... now, point your browser to: `http://yourdomain.com/INSTALL_LOCATION/index.php`

and login as 'admin' password 'admin'.  With this login, you can create new users, and change and delete the three template users.
